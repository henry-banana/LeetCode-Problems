Idea 1:

A number's ternary (base-3) representation consists of digits 0, 1, and 2
This is equivalent to representing a number using only 0s and 1s in ternary, because:

- 1 in a ternary digit means we take that power of 3
- 0 means we skip that power.
- If a digit is 2, we would need to use a power of 3 twice, which is not allowed
